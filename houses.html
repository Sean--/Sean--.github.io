					There are houndreds of different lords and their castles in Westeros, both major and minor. Some are known for honor, some for cruelty, some for their power and some for their weakness. It would be quite an endeavor to write about every house in westeros, so this page will only cover the major lords that hold the most power in Westeros.

					House Targaryen was a noble family of Valyria before they moved to the castle at Dragonstone in westeros, where they resided for 200 years before taking over Westeros and naming themselves Kings. They founded King's Landing and built the Red Keep effectively creating the unified Seven Kingdoms. They ruled for nearly three houndred years, before Robert Baratheon's rebellion drove them out. Targaryens are known for being either great or mad: there's no middle ground, and many of them are actually insane, but many are also great.

					The lords of house Greyjoy are the rulers of the Iron Islands, a small archipelago of islands that don't have very much in terms of natural resourses, so they built a great fleet to rival any other in Westeros. They are great raiders and a very proud people.

					The Starks are the honorable and solid house of the north. They rule the largest of the seven kingdoms, and the most desolate. The North is where winter hits the hardest, so the Starks must be tough in order to endure, and they are. The Starks are one of the oldest houses in Westeros, they have been kings since the Age of Heros. During Robert Baratheon's rebellion, Lord Rickard Stark and his heir Brandon went to Kings Landing to speak with the Mad King, who killed them, leaving Eddard "Ned" Stark as lord. Being an old friend of Robert's, and with his family members being killed, Ned became Robert's most valuable ally.
